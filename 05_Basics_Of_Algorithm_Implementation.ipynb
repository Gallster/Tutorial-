    "\n",
    "At its most basic level, an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or specifying tasks to be done. Although you can theoretically use an algorithm for almost any application, it is commonly used in computer science and mathematics. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following picture is a basic example of an algorithm: \n",

    "Algorithms are the cornerstone of the programming world, as every program revolves around the use of algorithms. Furthermore, algorithms are created independently from underlying languages and can therefore be implemented in every programming language. The following is a basic outline of how to create an algorithm for computer science:\n",
    "1. Understand the problem\n",
    "2. Think of different ways to solve it, and pick what you believe to be the most efficient way\n",
    "3. Map it out, using psuedo-code, a flowchart, or something similar\n",
    "4. Implement the solution, i.e. translate your method into the actual coding language\n",
    "5. Test and debug your code\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical example\n",
    "\n",
    "This is Bob. Bob has a walnut tree in his garden. Bob loves walnuts. He knows, that the his tree has already let fallen some nuts on the ground. While some of them are already rotten, the others are ready for pickung up and consuming. Bob knows, that over the next week, more and more walnuts will fall of the tree on the ground. Bob no wants to solve the problem of collecting the wallnuts. Since he's a computer scientist, he tackels the problem as a proper computerscientist would do it, for any problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bob tries to understand the problem:\n",
    "Bob wants to collect the walnuts. Some are still up on the tree getting ripe, the other are lying on the ground in de moisty gras: fresh an rotten ones. In addtion, the nuts are hard to spot in the gras and to distiguish between fresh and rotten, Bob has to pick them up to get a closer look. Bob also has a bucket for collecting. Of course Bob is only intersted in the non-rotten nuts.\n",

    "## Algorithm Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we want to focus on the fourth step of algorithm creation: implementation. In this step, we want to translate our method into our coding method of choice, and ensure that it is written in an elegant and an optimal way. In other words, we want to make sure that the program is compact and fast. Oftentimes, these goals are aligned, but sometimes they are not. These ideas are talked about in terms of time complexity and space complexity. These are defined as follows:\n",
    "- Time complexity: the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm as a function of the amount of input\n",
    "- Space complexity: the amount of space/memory taken by an algorithm as a function of the amount of input\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will primarily discuss time. Although time complexity is extremely difficult to measure, in Python we can get a rough idea of the time demands of an algorithm by using the time library. The time library can measure many different types of time, but we need to focus on wall-clock time and CPU time, i.e. natural and processing time. Wall-clock time is the time we, as humans, are familiar with. In other words, this is the time a stopwatch would read if you started it at the beginning of the process and ended it exactly as it finished. CPU time is the time the computer dedicates to the process. As computers are running multiple processes at a time, not 100% of the wall-clock time will be dedicated to the specific process you are measuring. CPU time avoids this issue, and allows a more comparable measure."

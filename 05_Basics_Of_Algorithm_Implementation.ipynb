    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you’re going to learn about the basics of algorithm implementation. The tutorial starts by explaining what an algorithm actually is. You will be told a story of a guy called Bob who wants to collect some nuts. The story will help you to develop an understanding of the underlying concepts of algorithms, such as how to design an algorithm and how to solve a general problem using the divide-and-conquer method. To judge the performance of your own or any other algorithm, you will learn about runtime and memory-usage as an indicator of quality for a certain algorithm. You will also learn about a function called “jit” that can optimize an algorithm very easily and there will also be a general discussion about the pros and cons of using Jit.  As an example of performance measurement, you will see the implementation of different solutions to a sorting-problem. Furthermore, with the use of another example, you will be taught about the problem of the so-called concept of stack overflow and how to avoid it. \n",

    "## What is an Algorithm?\n",
    "<a name=\"section1\"></a>\n",
    "At its most basic level, an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or specifying tasks to be done. Although you can theoretically use an algorithm for almost any application, it is commonly used in computer science and mathematics. \n",
    "\n",

    "### Practical example\n",
    "<a name=\"sub1.1\"></a>\n",
    "Let us introduce you to Bob. Bob has a walnut tree in his garden and he loves walnuts. He knows that there are walnuts from his tree in his garden. While some of them are already rotten, the others are ready for pickung and consuming. Bob knows, that over the next week, more and more walnuts will fall from the tree onto the ground. Bob now wants to solve the problem of collecting the walnuts. Since he's a computer scientist, he tackels the problem as a proper computer scientist would:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bob tries to understand the problem:\n",
    "   - Bob wants to collect the walnuts. Some are still in the tree getting ripe, others are lying on the ground in the moisty grass, fresh and rotten ones. In addition, the nuts are hard to spot in the grass and to distinguish between fresh and rotten, Bob has to pick them up to get a closer look. Bob also has a bucket for collecting where he will put the fresh nuts. Since reallife programming-problems are not like reallife problems, you need to structer your process of understanding a problem: you devide and conquer the problem: \"Collecting walnuts\" devides to \"find the nuts\" and \"pick it up\". And \"find the nuts\" devides to \"sens the nuts\", which can be solved by feeling them with your feets in the gras, using your hands, or just take a very close look. Also Bob has to be clear hat his aim clearly is: Does he want as many non-rotten nuts as possible, or will he be statisfied with just the majority?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Bob thinks about different ways to solve the problem of collecting nuts:\n",
    "   - Each of the part-solutions you get after divide and conquer can be put together in differents ways to solve the original problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "   * A: Bob could go to the tree and stay there with his bucket, observing the nuts falling down and collecting one by one \n",
    "   * B: Bob goes to the tree each day. Crouch walks under the tree through the grass. As he finds a nut, he decides, whether is rotten or not and put the non-rotten nuts in his bucket. \n",
    "   * C: Bob walks through the grass with his bucket, trying to feel the nuts with his feets and bend and collect them each time. When the bucket is full, he sorts out the rotten ones.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Map it out, using psuedo-code, a flowchart, or something similar\n",
    "   - this helps you to viszualice and and evaluate you solutions: While A would garantee you get close to all the nuts, it would take very long. B would be less time consuming but exhausting. And if Bob does it this way, the workload will grow from day to day, since he has to revaluate more and more rotten one, sinc he doesn't pick them up, theire number of evaluations each day will increase. So Bob goes for C: quick way, no bending and a more or less steady number of evaluations. Surely hi will no get the highest amount of non-rotten nuts, but still enough. Work smart, not hard. All the possible solutions have their pros and cons.\n",
    "   \n",
    "In our reallife-problem, Bob algorithm can be executed now. He is happy with his walnuts an proud of the smart algorithm he just implemented. In the following you will be thaught how to tackle a actual programming-problem. In Coding you also add two more steps, which are technical required, and not necessary in our reallife-problem:\n",

    "<a name=\"section2\"></a>\n",
    "Algorithms are the cornerstone of the programming world, as every program revolves around the use of algorithms. Furthermore, algorithms are created independently from underlying languages and can therefore be implemented in every programming language. The following is a basic outline of how to create an algorithm for computer science:\n",
    "1. Understand the problem\n",
    "2. Think of different ways to solve it, and pick what you believe to be the most efficient way\n",
    "3. Map it out, using psuedo-code, a flowchart, or something similar\n",
    "4. Implement the solution, i.e. translate your method into the actual coding language\n",
    "5. Test and debug your code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Implementation\n",
    "<a name=\"sub2.1\"></a>\n",
    "Today, we want to focus on the fourth step of algorithm creation: implementation. In this step, we want to translate our method into our coding method of choice, and ensure that it is written in an elegant and an optimal way. In other words, we want to make sure that the program is compact and fast. Oftentimes, these goals are aligned, but sometimes they are not. These ideas are talked about in terms of time complexity and space complexity. These are defined as follows:\n",
    "- **Time complexity**: the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm as a function of the amount of input\n",
    "- **Space complexity**: the amount of space/memory taken by an algorithm as a function of the amount of input\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will primarily discuss time. Although time complexity is extremely difficult to measure, in Python we can get a rough idea of the time demands of an algorithm by using the time library. The time library can measure many different types of time, but we need to focus on wall-clock time and CPU time, i.e. natural and processing time. Wall-clock time is the time we, as humans, are familiar with. In other words, this is the time a stopwatch would read if you started it at the beginning of the process and ended it exactly as it finished. CPU time is the time the computer dedicates to the process. As computers are running multiple processes at a time, not 100% of the wall-clock time will be dedicated to the specific process you are measuring. CPU time avoids this issue, and allows a more comparable measure.\n",

There is actually an already built-in function in Python to `sort()` a list but in order to visualize the implementation of algorithms, we will not use `sort()`"

The way that it works is by repeatedly running through a list or array and swapping the elements that are next to each other if they are in the incorrect order. Take, for example, this list: [1, 3, 2, 9, 6]. First, the function will compare the first two elements: 1 and 3. It sees that they are in order, and thus will not do anything. Next, it will compare 3 and 2, and seeing that they are not in order, will swap their positions, changing the list to [1, 2, 3, 9, 6]. The algorithm will continue this pattern for the rest of the list and then restart from the beginning to ensure that everything is in order, ending with the sorted list of [1, 2, 3, 6, 9].

If there is a problem that consists of a shorter list that only needs to be sorted once, it might be wiser to just use the simpler algorithm, even though it is less efficient.

    "As we can see, two of the three algorithms have tremendous performance improvement. By using the `@jit` wrapper, the algortihms could be processed much quicker than before. An interesting observation is that our `shell_sort()` algorithm is slower than before. This may be because of our original \"gap sequence\" being slower with the `numba` package or that the shell sort as a function works slower with JIT. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When using already defined functions, which is made by other users, there is a problem of not knowing excactly what the function does. As illustrated above with the use if JIT, the results from the shell short was not excactly what we were excpecting. There can be massive performance improvements but at the same time a problem can occur we did not excpect. So, when choosing wether to use `numba` compiler *JIT*, or maybe `sort()`, when solving a problem one should consider what the impact would be if the function does something else than expected. If the impact would be low and easily fixable, on can use the already defined functions. If the impact would be huge and very costly to fix, one should consider writing the code oneself. \n",

    "Local variables and parameters live on a thing called **stack**. The stack lives on the *top* of your adress space (memory cell for instance) and as it is being used, it is heading towards the *bottom* of your adress space (towards zero). The most common cause of a stack overflow is a bad recursive call. If your function does not contain the proper terminating condition (making your function to stop), the function will call itself forever. A stack overflow means that your function is demanding more space than it has dedicated. When this happens, you usually get an error message saying that the \"maximum recursion is met\", meaning that the process cannot access more space to find a solution. To solve this problem, go over your code and check whether you are using a proper terminating condition. "

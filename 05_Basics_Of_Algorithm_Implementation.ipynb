    "# Summary, What you will learn in this tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you’re going to learn about the basics of algorithm implementation. The tutorial starts by explaining what an algorithm actually is. You will be told a story of a guy called Bob who wants to collect some nuts; the story will help you to develop an understanding of the underlying concepts of algorithms, such as how to design an algorithm, how to solve a general problem using the divide-and-conquer method. To judge the performance of your own or any other algorithm, you will learn about runtime and memory-usage as an indicator of quality for a certain algorithm. You will also learn about a function called “jit” that can optimize an algorithm very easily and there will also be a general discussion about the pros and cons of using Jit.  As an example of performance measurement, you will see the implementation of different solutions to a sorting-problem. Furthermore, with the use of another example, you will be taught about the problem of the so-called concept of stack-overflow and his importance in programming. \n",

    "# What is an Algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "At its most basic level, an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or specifying tasks to be done. Although you can theoretically use an algorithm for almost any application, it is commonly used in computer science and mathematics. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following picture is a basic example of an algorithm: \n",

    "### Practical example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us introduce you to Bob. Bob has a walnut tree in his garden and he loves walnuts. He knows that there are walnuts from his tree in his garden. While some of them are already rotten, the others are ready for pickung and consuming. Bob knows, that over the next week, more and more walnuts will fall from the tree onto the ground. Bob now wants to solve the problem of collecting the walnuts. Since he's a computer scientist, he tackels the problem as a proper computer scientist would:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bob tries to understand the problem:\n",
    "Bob wants to collect the walnuts. Some are still in the tree getting ripe, others are lying on the ground in the moisty grass, fresh and rotten ones. In addition, the nuts are hard to spot in the grass and to distinguish between fresh and rotten, Bob has to pick them up to get a closer look. Bob also has a bucket for collecting where he will put the fresh nuts.\n",
    "2. Bob thinks about different ways to solve the problem of collecting nuts:\n",
    "Theoraticly \n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithms and programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms are the cornerstone of the programming world, as every program revolves around the use of algorithms. Furthermore, algorithms are created independently from underlying languages and can therefore be implemented in every programming language. The following is a basic outline of how to create an algorithm for computer science:\n",
    "1. Understand the problem\n",
    "2. Think of different ways to solve it, and pick what you believe to be the most efficient way\n",
    "3. Map it out, using psuedo-code, a flowchart, or something similar\n",
    "4. Implement the solution, i.e. translate your method into the actual coding language\n",
    "5. Test and debug your code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we want to focus on the fourth step of algorithm creation: implementation. In this step, we want to translate our method into our coding method of choice, and ensure that it is written in an elegant and an optimal way. In other words, we want to make sure that the program is compact and fast. Oftentimes, these goals are aligned, but sometimes they are not. These ideas are talked about in terms of time complexity and space complexity. These are defined as follows:\n",
    "- Time complexity: the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm as a function of the amount of input\n",
    "- Space complexity: the amount of space/memory taken by an algorithm as a function of the amount of input\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will primarily discuss time. Although time complexity is extremely difficult to measure, in Python we can get a rough idea of the time demands of an algorithm by using the time library. The time library can measure many different types of time, but we need to focus on wall-clock time and CPU time, i.e. natural and processing time. Wall-clock time is the time we, as humans, are familiar with. In other words, this is the time a stopwatch would read if you started it at the beginning of the process and ended it exactly as it finished. CPU time is the time the computer dedicates to the process. As computers are running multiple processes at a time, not 100% of the wall-clock time will be dedicated to the specific process you are measuring. CPU time avoids this issue, and allows a more comparable measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to the problem \n",
    "\n",
    "In the endeavor of visualizing the implementation of algorithms, we will define a problem and then try to solve it with two different algorithm implementation. The code you see below is creating a set amount of different integers and inserting them into a list. The problem at hand now will be to sort the list so that our result will be a list ordered from the least integer to the greatest. There is actually an already built-in function in Python to sort a list but in order to visualize the implementation of algorithms, we will write our own function.\n"

    "The function above is an implementation of a style of sorting algorithm called a bubble algorithm. In essence, this is the simplest sorting algorithm. The way that it works is by repeatedly running through a list or array and swapping the elements that are next to each other if they are in the incorrect order. Take, for example, this list: [1, 3, 2, 9, 6]. First, the function will compare the first two elements: 1 and 3. It sees that they are in order, and thus will not do anything. Next, it will compare 3 and 2, and seeing that they are not in order, will swap their positions, changing the list to [1, 2, 3, 9, 6]. The algorithm will continue this pattern for the rest of the list and then restart from the beginning to ensure that everything is in order, ending with the sorted list of [1, 2, 3, 6, 9]. The bubble sort is a popular implementation because of its simplicity, but it can be quite time intensive with longer lists or arrays.\n"

    "The result of the different types of code are remarkable. The loop version takes much longer than the matrix version. More general, Python's built-in function are that much optimated, that they usually will be faster. Time.time is not that precise. It can just be sure that the second is correct. This does not matter in this context, because the diffeence of the loop implementation and the matrix algebra are hugh. For not that clear results, other possibilities will be discussed in chapter 3.<br>\n",
